# Simple Tic Tac Toe Game

## About the project

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game I made from a course I was taking. I made it on my own and used the course files to fix some bugs.

## Key takeaways

- I wrote all the functions in a different file to keep the order
- Use of dictionaries and tuple unpacking
- Use of Git during the project
- I tried using the terminal for almost everything I did
